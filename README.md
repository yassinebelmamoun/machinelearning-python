# Machine Learning Implementation with Python 

Implementation of relevant machine learning algorithms in a clear and concise way

## Synopsis

Machine learning is currently a buzzword. The goal here is to walk away with a better understanding of 8 different machine learning algorithms.
You will find in this repository the implementation of relevant machine learning algorithms in a clear and concise way.

## Summary

1. Installation
2. Algorithms
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Dicision Trees
  * Support vector Machines (SVM)
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Random Forests
  * K-Means Clustering

## Installation & Dependencies

I use Python 3.6.2.
We will use the following libraries:
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Numpy
  * Seaborn
You can simply install requirements.txt by doing:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
